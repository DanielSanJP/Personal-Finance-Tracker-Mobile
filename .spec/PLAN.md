## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Architecture Choices

#### 1. Expo Router vs. React Navigation

**Decision**: Expo Router  
**Rationale**:

- File-based routing (simpler, less boilerplate)
- Typed routes for TypeScript safety
- Better web support with URL-based navigation
- Official Expo recommendation for new projects

#### 2. React Query vs. Redux

**Decision**: TanStack React Query  
**Rationale**:

- Server state management is primary concern
- Automatic caching and invalidation
- Optimistic updates built-in
- Less boilerplate than Redux
- Better performance with stale-while-revalidate

#### 3. NativeWind vs. StyleSheet

**Decision**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)  
**Rationale**:

- Consistent with modern web development practices
- Utility-first approach reduces custom CSS
- Responsive design utilities
- Dark mode support preparation
- Developer experience (faster iteration)

#### 4. Supabase vs. Firebase

**Decision**: Supabase  
**Rationale**:

- PostgreSQL (familiar SQL, better for complex queries)
- Row Level Security (RLS) for fine-grained access control
- Real-time subscriptions (future feature)
- Open-source alternative
- Better pricing for growing apps

#### 5. Universal Party Transaction Model

**Decision**: `from_party` and `to_party` instead of `merchant`  
**Rationale**:

- Unified data model for all transaction types
- More flexible for future features (P2P transfers, bill splits)
- Better query capabilities (filter by party)
- Clearer money flow representation
- Supports income sources, merchants, and accounts uniformly

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Android Transaction Limit

**Problem**: Loading 1000+ transactions causes crashes on Android devices  
**Solution**: Limit to 500 transactions max  
**Tradeoff**: Users with extensive history need to use filters/search  
**Future**: Implement pagination or virtual scrolling

#### 2. Client-Side Filtering

**Problem**: Server-side filtering adds latency  
**Solution**: Fetch all transactions once, filter client-side  
**Tradeoff**: Higher initial load, but faster subsequent filters  
**Benefit**: Works well with React Query caching

#### 3. RPC for Complex Queries

**Problem**: Multiple round-trips for budget calculations  
**Solution**: PostgreSQL RPC functions for server-side aggregation  
**Benefit**: Single query returns calculated spending per category  
**Example**: `get_current_month_spending_by_category`

#### 4. Query Cache Strategy

**Decision**: Different stale times for guest vs. authenticated users  
**Rationale**:

- Guest data never changes → longer stale time (10 min)
- Authenticated data changes frequently → shorter stale time (5 min)
- Reduces unnecessary refetches for demo users

### Security Decisions

#### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)

**Decision**: Enable RLS on all tables  
**Rationale**:

- Defense in depth (server-side enforcement)
- Cannot bypass with client manipulation
- Automatic filtering by user ID
- Required for secure multi-tenant architecture

#### 2. PKCE Flow for Auth

**Decision**: Use PKCE instead of implicit flow  
**Rationale**:

- More secure for mobile apps
- Prevents authorization code interception
- OAuth 2.0 best practice for native apps
- Supabase default recommendation

#### 3. Guest Mode Implementation

**Decision**: Dedicated guest user ID with read-only access  
**Rationale**:

- No anonymous data creation (cleaner database)
- Consistent UX (demo data always available)
- Easy to block write operations
- Encourages sign-up for persistent data

#### 4. EAS Secrets for Environment Variables

**Decision**: Use EAS Secrets instead of committing values to `eas.json`  
**Rationale**:

- Security: API keys never committed to version control
- Flexibility: Can update secrets without code changes
- Multi-environment: Different secrets per build profile (dev, preview, prod)
- Team collaboration: Secrets managed centrally in EAS
- Command: `eas secret:create --scope project --name KEY_NAME --value "..." --force`

**Implementation**:

```bash
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL --value "..." --force
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY --value "..." --force
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY --value "..." --force
```

Secrets are automatically injected during build:

- `eas.json` remains clean (no `env` sections with values)
- Build logs confirm: "Environment variables loaded from the 'preview' environment on EAS"
- Works for all build profiles: development, preview, production

### UI/UX Decisions

#### 1. Tab Navigation

**Decision**: Bottom tabs for main sections  
**Rationale**:

- Mobile-first design pattern
- Easy thumb access on phones
- Clear visual indication of current section
- Standard pattern in finance apps

#### 2. Modal-Based Forms

**Decision**: Modals for create/edit operations  
**Rationale**:

- Maintains context (users see where they came from)
- Faster interactions (no navigation)
- Clearer cancel vs. save options
- Better for bulk operations

#### 3. Toast Notifications

**Decision**: Toast instead of inline messages  
**Rationale**:

- Non-intrusive feedback
- Auto-dismiss after success
- Doesn't disrupt flow
- Consistent across all actions

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

#### 1. Gemini API Quota/Limits

**Risk**: AI features stop working if API quota exceeded  
**Mitigation**:

- Error handling with clear user messages
- Graceful degradation (manual entry still works)
- Monitor usage and upgrade plan if needed
- Consider caching common receipt types

#### 2. Android Performance on Low-End Devices

**Risk**: App crashes or lags on older Android phones  
**Mitigation**:

- Transaction limit (500 max)
- Lazy loading for images
- Optimistic UI updates
- Test on low-end devices during QA

#### 3. Supabase Downtime

**Risk**: Backend unavailable affects all users  
**Mitigation**:

- React Query caching (offline reads work)
- Clear error messages for users
- Monitor Supabase status page
- Consider implementing offline queue for writes

#### 4. App Store Rejection

**Risk**: App rejected for policy violations  
**Mitigation**:

- Follow all platform guidelines
- Clear privacy policy
- Proper permissions handling
- No hidden functionality
